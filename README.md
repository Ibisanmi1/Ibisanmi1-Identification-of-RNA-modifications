This repo is crafted to identify RNA modifications from Nanopore sequencing data. This project is motivated, in conjunction with a prof. (anonymous) currently investigating the determination of splicing order in neurological diseases, to accurately detect RNA modifications post-exon splicing. This capability holds paramount importance in determining the sequence of splicing events, thereby playing a pivotal role in devising effective therapeutic approaches.
